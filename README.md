# avui
Simple TUI for quickly connecting to existing scripts/tools.
This is intended to be a simple TUI with very basic features. The idea is to create a common library to handle graphically some information while connected to remote terminals. Daily I have to connect to hundreds of servers (linux) remotely and also manage Docker containers (in the servers or in Kubernetes in the cloud - AWS). At work, we do use IaaC (Ansible) for managing everything, but we still have tons of scripts written in Bash or Python to perform special tasks. Many times, while troubleshooting, I find myself typing the same commands over and over. Thus the idea to delegate some of this "monitoring/watching" tasks to a way to better track logs, changes, statuses, etc, etc. If you work as sysadmin, devops, etc, you know what I'm talking about. So, this library/utilities/helper should allow me to quickly connect my existing tools, scripts, etc, to a better form of managing the information. The idea is to always keep this simple.
